            <h2>Myna Project</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Myna is an energy management application. This project was thought to give a simple user-friendly interface to both manage the heating system and monitor climatic variables in a small-medium house.</p>
        <p>Its flat and minimal style allows the app to be used on all devices and in a simple way even by people not really technology-friendly. </p>
        <p>Main features are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>temperature control using manual, automatic threshold or time programming;</li>
            <li>real-time monitoring;</li>
            <li>data storage and graphic representation up to one-year backward;</li>
            <li>heat countering with economic values estimation;</li>
            <li>alerting system (email and/or SMS);</li>
            <li>remote exclusive access from any device connected on the web.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The application could run on a single board computer connected wired or wireless to sensors and actuators easily to configure.</p>
